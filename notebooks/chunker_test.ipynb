      "Cairo, August 11, 2025: Beltone Holding ('Beltone' or the 'Company'), one of the fastest growing financial institutions, announces its consolidated financial and operational results for the six-month period ending 30 June 2025.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Beltone has maintained its strong growth momentum into the first half of 2025, with consolidated operating revenue more than doubling  year-on-year  (YoY)  to  EGP6.3  billion.  The  robust  expansion  in  operating  revenue  translated  directly  to  enhanced profitability, evidenced by a 60% YoY increase in net profit after tax and minority interest, which reached EGP1.3 billion in 1H2025.\n",
      "- Operating revenue for Beltone Investment Bank grew 137% year-on-year to EGP1.1 billion in 1H2025. This growth was driven by a seven-fold year-on-year increase in Investment Banking revenue, alongside continued growth in the Securities Brokerage division, which saw its market share expand to 4.3%. The Investment Bank's outstanding portfolio recorded remarkable growth of 267% year-on-year, closing the period at EGP5.4 billion.\n",
      "- On the asset management front, Beltone retained its leadership position as Egypt's largest non -bank affiliated asset management with assets under management reaching EGP27.3 billion as of 30 June 2025. In the first half of the year, the division launched six new funds including five equity sector funds as well as the Beltone USD Fixed Income Fund.\n",
      "- Beltone's NBFIs Platform continues to be the primary growth engine, with operating revenue climbing 111% year-on-year to EGP5.0 billion in 1H2025, fuelled by significant growth across all subsidiaries. As of 30 June 2025, the outstanding portfolio stood at EGP29.4 billion, growing 93% year-on-year.\n",
      "- The leasing &amp; factoring division was the key contributor to portfolio growth, with its outstanding portfolios expanding by 78% YoY to reach EGP14.5 billion as of 30 June 2025. In May 2025, the division successfully concluded its second securitization issuance, with a total value of EGP2 billion, underscoring Beltone's leading position in structured finance and alternative funding solution s.\n",
      "- The mortgage finance business was the second-largest contributor with its portfolio more than doubling year-on-year to reach EGP7.3 billion at the end of 2Q2025. The mortgage division's substantial growth plays a pivotal role in Beltone's strategy to create a comprehensive, full-service financial platform, while simultaneously advancing the development and accessibility of the Egyptian mortgage industry.\n",
      "- In line with its ongoing international growth ambitions, Beltone Capital signed a share purchase agreement to acquire a majority stake in Baobab, a financial services provider dedicated to SMEs across seven African markets with half a million customers.\n",
      "- In  Q2 2025, Beltone completed the financial consolidation of its securitization arm, Beltone Securitization. This strategic move enhances operational synergy and execution efficiency for future issuances, while further strengthening Beltone's capabilitie s as a full-service, end-to-end financial platform.\n",
      "- In April 2025, Beltone finalized a capital increase of EGP 10.5 billion, the largest cash capital raise in EGX history for the second time.\n",
      "- In July 2025, Beltone officially launched Robin, a core milestone in its transformation into a data-first financial powerhouse. Robin aims to empower businesses through advanced analytics and AI-powered decision-making, enhancing growth, sustainability, and operational efficiency across markets.\n",
